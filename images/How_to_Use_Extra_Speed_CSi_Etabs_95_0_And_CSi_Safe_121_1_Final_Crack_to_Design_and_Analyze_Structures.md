## What is perform-3d?
 
perform-3d is a software tool that performs element-oriented finite element analysis in 3d using finite elements of any type and in all three directions, taking into account the effects of coupled elements or other displacements. perform-3d can handle structures with or without post-tensioning, as well as nonlinear effects such as strain hardening and softening, buckling, cracking, and plasticity. perform-3d can also analyze beams, columns, and slab systems using both fiber models and beam families. perform-3d is ideal for analyzing complex structures that require advanced nonlinear analysis techniques.
 
## What is safe?
 
safe is a software tool that specializes in the design and analysis of architectural concrete structures, such as building walls, floors, and foundations. safe can analyze shapes, grading, and excavation as well as provide load capacity, cost, and a visual presentation. safe can also handle forms and thicknesses including numerical specification of both. safe is a development product of the schlumberger cept laboratory , which is a research center for computational engineering and physics. safe is perfect for designing and optimizing concrete structures that require high performance and efficiency.
 
## What is csi technologies?
 
csi technologies is a software company that develops, markets, supports and services a family of software solutions that are used in the analysis of geotechnical and civil engineering structures, as well as the protection of historic structures. csi technologies offers a range of products, such as csi bridge, csi column, csi sap2000, csi etabs, csi safe, csi perform-3d, csi section builder, csi shape builder, csi steel design module, csi concrete design module, csi foundation design module, csi seismic design module, csi wind load generator module, csi fire resistance module, csi retrofit module, csi damage assessment module, csi repair module, csi monitoring module, csi inspection module, csi testing module, csi documentation module, and more. csi technologies also provides technical services, such as analytical, computer, and engineering services. csi technologies is a member of the schlumberger group , which is a global leader in oilfield services and technology.
