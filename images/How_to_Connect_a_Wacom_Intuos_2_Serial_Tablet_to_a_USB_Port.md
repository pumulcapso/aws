One option is to buy a serial to USB adapter cable that can plug into your tablet and your computer. However, not all adapters are compatible with Wacom tablets, and you might need to install additional drivers or software to make it work. You can check the Wacom website for a list of recommended adapters[^1^]. Alternatively, you can search online for other users' experiences with different adapters and see what works for them.
 
Another option is to build your own USB bridge for your tablet using a hardware project called Waxbee[^3^]. This involves soldering a Teensy 2.0 microcontroller board to your tablet's circuit board and flashing it with a custom firmware that emulates a USB tablet. You will also need a mini-USB cable to connect the Teensy to your computer. This option requires some technical skills and tools, but it can give you more control over the tablet's features and compatibility. You can find detailed instructions and resources on the Waxbee GitHub page[^3^].
 
A third option is to upgrade your tablet to a newer model that supports USB natively. Wacom offers a range of pen tablets for different needs and budgets, such as the Wacom Intuos[^1^], the Wacom Intuos Pro[^1^], or the Wacom One[^2^]. These tablets come with a USB cable and a driver that you can download and install from the Wacom website[^1^]. They also offer additional features such as wireless connectivity, pressure sensitivity, tilt recognition, multi-touch gestures, customizable buttons, and more. You can compare the different models and find the one that suits you best on the Wacom website[^1^].
 
Whatever option you choose, you can enjoy using your Wacom tablet with your computer and unleash your creativity.

If you choose to use a serial to USB adapter or a Waxbee USB bridge, you might need to adjust some settings on your computer or your tablet to make them work properly. For example, you might need to change the COM port number, the baud rate, the data bits, the parity, or the stop bits. You can find more information on how to do this on the Wacom website or on the Waxbee GitHub page. You might also need to calibrate your tablet's active area and orientation to match your screen size and resolution. You can do this using the Wacom Tablet Properties program on your computer.
 
If you choose to upgrade your tablet to a newer model, you can enjoy the benefits of a USB connection and more. For example, you can use the Wacom Desktop Center program on your computer to customize your tablet's settings, such as the pen pressure curve, the button functions, the touch gestures, and more. You can also access helpful resources such as tutorials, tips, support, and software downloads. You can also register your tablet and get complimentary software that you can use with your tablet, such as drawing, painting, editing, or animation programs. You can find out more about these software offers on the Wacom website.
 
Whether you have an old or a new Wacom tablet, you can use it with a variety of applications and programs that support pen input. For example, you can use it with Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketchbook, Clip Studio Paint, Krita, and more. You can also use it with online tools such as Google Jamboard, Miro, Figma, and more. You can find a list of compatible applications and programs on the Wacom website. You can also explore new ways of getting creative with your tablet using online tutorials, courses, or communities.
